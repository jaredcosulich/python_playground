# Python AI Playground

This is a series of small functions demonstrating common techniques in AI software development.

Each function demonstrates something relatively simple and has associated tests.

All tests are located next to the file containing the functions and can be run with:

pytest path/to/test_file.py

Or to run all tests:

pytest **/*_test.py
